# CZhangy's Survival Guides

## Project Summary
CZhangy's Survival Guides are a group of write-ups for computed science-related courses that I have taken at UCLA. They are intended to help teach course material from a student's perspective, and are readily available online, in a basic, responsive format for those that would like to use them. 

The most up-to-date version of CZhangy's Survival Guides is currently deployed at: https://czhangy-survival-guides.netlify.app/.
